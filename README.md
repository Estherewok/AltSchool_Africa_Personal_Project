# Personal_Project
Cross-section data originating from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey survey conducted inÂ 1996.

The aim of this project is to leverage data analysis and visualization techniques to explore key factors influencing health insurance coverage in the United States. By utilizing a cross-sectional dataset from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

### Project Objectives:

Investigate the influence of demographic factors: I aim to understand how age, gender, region, ethnicity, education level, marital status, and employment type shape health insurance coverage. By analyzing these variables, I can uncover patterns and disparities within the dataset.

Explore preferences for health insurance plans: I will examine the relationship between ethnicity and education level with health insurance preferences. By doing so, I can identify variations and disparities in coverage based on cultural, socioeconomic, and educational factors.

Examine the impact of marital status on health insurance coverage: I aim to understand how marital status influences the likelihood of having health insurance. By comparing coverage rates between married and unmarried individuals, I can shed light on the importance of marital status in healthcare policies.

Assess the relationship between self-employment and health insurance: I will investigate whether self-employed individuals are more or less likely to have health insurance compared to those in traditional employment. This analysis can help identify potential challenges and disparities faced by self-employed individuals in obtaining coverage.

Investigate the association between health insurance coverage and health status: I will explore the relationship between health insurance coverage and individuals' health status. By understanding this association, I can gain insights into how health status influences insurance decisions and highlight the importance of comprehensive coverage for individuals' overall well-being.

Through this project, I hope to provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of health insurance coverage and contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding healthcare access and equity.
